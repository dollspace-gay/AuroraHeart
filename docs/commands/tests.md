# Generate Tests

Please generate comprehensive unit tests for the selected code.

Generate tests that cover:
1. **Happy path**: Normal, expected inputs and behavior
2. **Edge cases**: Boundary conditions, empty inputs, maximum values
3. **Error cases**: Invalid inputs, error handling, exceptions
4. **Integration points**: Mocked dependencies, external systems
5. **State changes**: Before/after conditions, side effects
6. **Concurrent scenarios**: Thread safety, race conditions (if applicable)

For each test:
- Use the project's testing framework
- Follow existing test naming conventions
- Include descriptive test names that explain what's being tested
- Add helpful comments for complex assertions
- Aim for high code coverage

Organize tests logically and make them maintainable.
