# Refactor Code

Please suggest refactoring improvements for the selected code.

Analyze for:
1. **Code Smells**: Long methods, large classes, duplicate code, complex conditionals
2. **Design Patterns**: Opportunities to apply appropriate patterns
3. **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, etc.
4. **Naming**: More descriptive variable/function/class names
5. **Structure**: Better organization, separation of concerns
6. **Simplification**: Reduce complexity, remove unnecessary code
7. **Testability**: Make code easier to test

For each suggestion:
- Explain the current problem
- Show the refactored version
- Explain the benefits of the change
- Note any trade-offs or considerations

Prioritize changes by impact and effort required.
