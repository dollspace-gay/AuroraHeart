instructions are being sent to Claude through three primary mechanisms: Session Hooks (which modify the main session behavior), Agent Definitions (which define specialized personas for specific tasks), and Command Instructions (which provide step-by-step procedures).

1. Session Hooks (Global Instructions)
These plugins use a SessionStart hook to inject specific behavioral instructions into Claude's context at the beginning of a session.

Explanatory Output Style

Source: plugins/explanatory-output-style/hooks-handlers/session-start.sh

Instruction: "You are in 'explanatory' output style mode... provide educational insights about the codebase as you help with the user's task."

Specific Directive: Before and after writing code, Claude must provide an "Insight" block:

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
[2-3 key educational points]
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
Learning Output Style

Source: plugins/learning-output-style/hooks-handlers/session-start.sh

Instruction: "You are in 'learning' output style mode... instead of implementing everything yourself, identify opportunities where the user can write 5-10 lines of meaningful code."

Specific Directive: Claude is instructed to ask the user to implement business logic or design choices, while handling boilerplate itself. It also includes the "Explanatory" mode insights.

2. Agent Definitions (Specialized Personas)
These files define "Sub-Agents" with specific system prompts, roles, and responsibilities.

Feature Development Agents (plugins/feature-dev/agents/)

code-architect: "You are a senior software architect... deliver comprehensive, actionable architecture blueprints."

code-explorer: "You are an expert code analyst specializing in tracing and understanding feature implementations..."

code-reviewer: "You are an expert code reviewer... review code against project guidelines in CLAUDE.md with high precision."

PR Review Toolkit Agents (plugins/pr-review-toolkit/agents/)

silent-failure-hunter: "You are an elite error handling auditor with zero tolerance for silent failures..."

comment-analyzer: "You are a meticulous code comment analyzer... protect codebases from comment rot..."

pr-test-analyzer: "You are an expert test coverage analyst... ensure that PRs have adequate test coverage..."

type-design-analyzer: "You are a type design expert... evaluating type designs with a critical eye toward invariant strength..."

code-simplifier: "You are an expert code simplification specialist focused on enhancing code clarity... while preserving exact functionality."

Plugin Development Agents (plugins/plugin-dev/agents/)

agent-creator: "You are an elite AI agent architect specializing in crafting high-performance agent configurations."

plugin-validator: "You are an expert plugin validator specializing in comprehensive validation of Claude Code plugin structure..."

skill-reviewer: "You are an expert skill architect specializing in reviewing and improving Claude Code skills..."

Other Agents

conversation-analyzer (Hookify): "You are a conversation analysis specialist that identifies problematic behaviors... that could be prevented with hooks."

agent-sdk-verifier (SDK Dev): "You are a [Python/TypeScript] Agent SDK application verifier."

3. Command Instructions (Task Workflows)
Specific slash commands contain prompt logic to guide Claude through complex multi-step tasks.

/code-review (plugins/code-review/commands/code-review.md):

Instructs Claude to launch 5 parallel agents to review code for CLAUDE.md compliance, bugs, history, previous PRs, and comments.

Then launches a "Haiku agent" to score issues from 0-100 based on confidence.

Instruction: "Filter out any issues with a score less than 80."

/ralph-loop (plugins/ralph-wiggum/commands/ralph-loop.md):

Instruction: "When you try to exit, the Ralph loop will feed the SAME PROMPT back to you for the next iteration... If a completion promise is set, you may ONLY output it when the statement is completely and unequivocally TRUE."

/commit-push-pr (plugins/commit-commands/commands/commit-push-pr.md):

Instruction: "You MUST do all of the above [branch, commit, push, pr] in a single message. Do not use any other tools or do anything else."

/oncall-triage (.claude/commands/oncall-triage.md):

Instruction: "You're an oncall triage assistant... identify critical issues that require immediate oncall attention... Be conservative - only flag issues that truly prevent users from getting work done."
